# go-sandbox
First steps with Go Language

Epic:

- sort images by year/month. We want to leave album management to some tool like Picasa, 
but also keep some kind of order in filesystem, if we choose to use another tool at some point in time. 


User Stories:

# crawl all images in a directory (including subdirectories) and read timestamp information
- copy files to appropriate folders


Engineering Tasks:

- walking skeleton (command line tool, that can take a folder as an argument and print it to console)
- crawl all images in that directory
- print info about crawled images to console (amount, file formats)
